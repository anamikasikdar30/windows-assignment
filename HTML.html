<p>

As told earlier, HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces <Tag Name>. Except few tags, most of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. For example, <html> has its closing tag </html> and <body> tag has its closing tag </body> tag etc.

Above example of HTML document uses the following tags −

<table border="1" width="50%" height="40%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Sr.No</th>
				<th>Tag & Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td><code><!DOCTYPE...></code>
                    This tag defines the document type and HTML version.

                </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td><html>
                    This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises of document header which is represented by <head>...</head> and document body which is represented by <body>...</body> tags.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td><head>
                    This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML tags like <title>, <link> etc.

                </td>
		    </tr>			
		<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td><title>
                    The <title> tag is used inside the <head> tag to mention the document title.

                </td>
				</tr>

				<td><h1>
                    This tag represents the heading.

                </td>
		</tr>
