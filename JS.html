<p>
Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Javascript:
<ul>
<li>
Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.
</li>
<li>
Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.

<h2>
Applications of Javascript Programming
</h2>
<p>
As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages (Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:
<ul>
<li>
Client side validation - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.
</li>
<li>Manipulating HTML Pages - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.
</li>
<li>
User Notifications - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.
</li>
<li>
Back-end Data Loading - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.
</li>
<li>
Presentations - JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentations.
</li>
<li>
Server Applications - Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.

This list goes on, there are various areas where millions of software developers are happily using Javascript to develop great websites and others softwares.
</li>
</ul>

For this Javascript tutorial, it is assumed that the reader have a prior knowledge of HTML coding. It would help if the reader had some prior exposure to object-oriented programming concepts and a general idea on creating online applications.
</p>
<h2>
Advantages of JavaScript

</h2>

<p>
The merits of using JavaScript are −</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
	</li>
	<li>
		Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
	</li>
	<li>
		Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
	</li>
	<li>
		Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Limitations of JavaScript
</h2>
<p>

We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features −
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.
	</li>
	<li>
		JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.
	</li>
	<li>
		JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.
	</li>
	<li>
		Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages./
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>
JavaScript Development Tools
</h2>
<p>
One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler.
<br><br>
To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed here −
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Microsoft FrontPage − Microsoft has developed a popular HTML editor called FrontPage. FrontPage also provides web developers with a number of JavaScript tools to assist in the creation of interactive websites.
	</li>
	<li>
		Macromedia Dreamweaver MX − Macromedia Dreamweaver MX is a very popular HTML and JavaScript editor in the professional web development crowd. It provides several handy prebuilt JavaScript components, integrates well with databases, and conforms to new standards such as XHTML and XML.
	</li>
	<li>
		Macromedia HomeSite 5 − HomeSite 5 is a well-liked HTML and JavaScript editor from Macromedia that can be used to manage personal websites effectively.
